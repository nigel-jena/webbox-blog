This is because we have just bought and installed a new state of the art web server that is very fast.<br /><br />Not only is it very fast, but it is also extremely robust with redundant hard drives, power supplies and network cards. Redundant means that there is a duplicate device, so if one fails the second one automatically takes over without any down time.<br /><br />It cost us a whole lot of money, but we know that it is well worth it as page load times are an integral part of your website user experience. <br /><br />We hope you are enjoying your new zippier web-box experience.<br />
