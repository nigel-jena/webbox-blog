And these property alert emails are a very important  part of their sales process.<br /><br />Property alerts do the following:<br /><ul><li>Enable buyers to be notified of your properties for sale.</li><li>Enable you to present properties to hundreds or thousands of interested buyers.&nbsp;</li><li>They happen automatically - no extra work (phone calls or emails) or  costs (phone calls) are required to get your new properties in front of  all of your interested buyers.&nbsp;</li><li>They happen fast - go out at 8am the day after the property is  uploaded to your website. If its an open mandate it could mean you  presenting it to the buyer before another agent … and therefore making  the sale!&nbsp;</li><li>They ensure that all of your interested buyers are notified - there  is no human error where you or one of your agents could forget to  present the property to a buyer.&nbsp;</li><li>Build brand recognition - people know you are professional and active. </li></ul><br />We have noticed that agencies that have great success  with their website are often the agencies with a lot of subscribers.  These agencies continuously add email addresses to their website  subscriber lists.<br /><br />By using the following 3 simple  sources for subscriber/buyer emails you will be surprised at how quickly  you can build up your subscriber list and increase your sales. <br /><ul><li> showhouses</li><li>when talking to potential buyers over the phone&nbsp;</li><li>from your incoming emails </li></ul><br />And of course you should be uploading all your  properties to your website as soon as you get them - so that they can  automatically be emailed to your subscribers.<br /><br />We would love to know what you think, so please email us at feedback@webbox.co.za <br /><br /><br /><br />
